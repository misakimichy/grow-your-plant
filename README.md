# Grow Your Own Plant

#### _C#, .NET: Grow Your Own Plant 9/26/2019_

## Description
Create a console application to grow your own plant. Each round, the plant should grow a certain amount (or fail to grow).

## Application should have:
- `Plant` class has methods for allowing the plant to grow.

- There are `Water()`, `Feed()` and `GiveSunshine()` methods to grow and make your plant happy.

- There are `NoSun()`, `Windstorm()`, `WeedsGrow()` and `EatPlant()` methods, which cause a trouble for your plant.

- A trouble event happens randomly but every time you take care of your plant.

- It's sad but when `EatPlant()` method is called, the game will be over.
